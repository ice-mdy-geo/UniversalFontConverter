**INTRODUCTION**
Myanmar language is the only official language of Myanmar formerly known as Burma, which is adapted from the Mon script. And the Mon script is derived from the Indian Brahmi flourished in the Indian subcontinent between 5th century BC and 3th century AD. Myanmar language has 33 consonants and 12 vowels according to traditional tones on grammar.
Since 1990, Myanmar natural language processing task has been done by Myanmar Unicode&NLP Research Center. The first Myanmar Unicode font for GUI environment was developed. Myanmar language processing was first dicussed at ISO/IEC JTCI and Unicode Technical Committee and finally Myanmar character code set was included in ISO 10646.
Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium and contains a repertoire of 137,439 characters covering 146 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emojis.
Zawgyi font is a non-Unicode typeface for the Burmese script. It is predominant typeface the used of Burmese language text on websites. It is a font with Burmese characters and also known as Zawgyi-one font although updated versions of the font were not named Zawgyi-two. It is the most popular font on Burmese websites.
WinInnwa has become popular as it is useful and can solve manv complicated Myanmar charavter issue. It is efficiently and further provided global search volume and competition of keywords. Using these keyword data and image resources can not only effectively guide your work and study but also provide high-quality resources entry for you when writing articles, posting blogs, designing ads and other online advertising campaigns.
Until now, many reserchers keep on trying over Myanmar language processing tasks to cope well with all applications so as to complete all the tasks to cover the whole area which requires more endeavors.
In this project, the program that can automatically convert Myanmar words from the Myanmar Web Pages proposed. The main purposed of this project is to present the analysis of Myanmar Web Pages to support font of using conversion from one to another. To establish the font converter, it is needed to do a lot of tasks.
In this study, we have collected Myanmar words from various Myanmar Web Sites and converted them from one font to another. And then, detail process of converting words and analysis of result data will be discussed in next sections.

**Background of the project**
-We have to know about the methods, approaches, programming languages and tools in developing the project.
-In this project, we use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and Materialize is to draw our web site's design.
-And then, we use Git, Github and Heroku is to post for our working tasks.
-We also use Python is to know how write the code.
-Finally, we use Gitbush and Pycharm is to write for our program code.

**Objective of the project**
-To use easily for many users by using conversion from one font to another
-To know how many characters are in fonts(Zawgyi, Unicode, WinInnwa)
-To help where they are applied
-To know how they are used
-To study differences between them

**METHODOLOGY**
**Software Requirements**
-Python 3.6(64-bits)
-JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition 2018.1.4
-Heroku CLI
-Git Bash
-Github Desktop
-Skype
-Messenger

**Hardware Requirements**
-Android phones
-Internet access
-PC with Window OS

**EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION**
**Conclusion**
In this project, we presented word segmentation program for Myanmar text based on World Wide Web. Then, we presented both word level and character level by this program. The program performed segmentation work well and proved itself to be used as a practical word. For future task, we plan to extend our program by converting all possible Myanmar words. It is hope that this project wil give benefits for our Myanmar language development tasks.

**Advantages of the project**
-Font converter utility help format portability and compatibility that severs the purpose of using conversion from one font to another.
-In this present scenario, interchangable formats are more in demand and software developers around the world need utilities that can convert files from one font to another easily and without too much difficulty.
-This is where the font converter utility comes into the play and the benefits of using the same are requierd.
-Furthermore, many of the users(example;IT Technicians, Typists and Staffs in Literature teams) use the converted files to store and retrieve data whenever they needed.
-This helps, files restoring of files at one's convenience making life easier for everyone in the processes.

**Limitation of the project**
-Although Unicode is and international language, it cannot be used easily and understood for everyone.
-Although some of the code-points in Zawgyi are similar to the Myanmar scripts as encoded in Unicode, the font does not correspond to the correct Unicode encoding and therefore is incompatible.
-In WinInnwa, many of us cannot remember all the alphabets on the keys which one contains four alphabets so it is very hard to recognize all of them. Therefore, WinInnwa Keyboard Layout is a handly one to reply on.
